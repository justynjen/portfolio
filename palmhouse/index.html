  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <hr />
  <p> Hi, I'm Justyn Gourdin. I started traveling the world two years ago. I have run a travel blog ever since leaving home but found that I enjoyed redesigning websites as much as I loved writing on my blog. I am working on creating a strong brand for myself as a freelancer, and be able to continue living remotely around the world as I work. I love building websites because you can start with absolutley nothing and end up with a usable and beautiful website for hundreds to use. </p>

  <h2> Mission </h2>
  <hr />

  <p> As you know there are lots of villa rentals all over Bali. Having a strong online presence and being able to rank in google searches is going to be the best way to get the attention of potential customers. You may not know this, but Bali was ranked the number one travel destination of this year. This news alone is going to bring thousands of tourists to the beautiful island. With the up and coming location that Canggu, there is no reason you shouldn't be booked out every night. I think for your villa it is going to be important to focus on your google ranking as opposed to airbnb for bookings. On airbnb people are looking at location and price. Location and price are not your selling points, your selling points are your luxurious property and outstanding hosiptality. You want to be the first result when someone searches for something like "beautiful villa in bali for groups" or "luxurious bali villa for groups". What I am offering is a website that will be SEO optimised so that you will be ranking in google in order to get customers. A website where they will find all needed information about your villa as well as the surrounding area. </p>

  <h2> Objective </h2>
  <hr />
  <p> The objective is to overhaul the existing site to better reflect and showcase the brand. The focus will be on making the new site: </p>
  <ul>
     <li> visually stunning design </li>
     <li> simple, user-friendly navigation that encourages users to browse further </li>
     <li> SEO (Search Engine Optimised) site for strong rankings for relevant key words (I will search out all the keywords) </li>
     <li> fast to load and compatible across all modern browsers</li>
     <li> easy for non-technical users to update and maintain </li>
     <li> mobile and tablet friendly (responsive) design </li>
     <li> built in the latest web technologies</li>
     <li> information on your site about the surrounding area so guests know why they should stay with you </li>
     <li> a video walk through for your homepage, so that people can really get a feel for the Palm House </li>
     <li> a blog element with 10 posts about Bali, Canggu and The Palm House </li>
  </ul>

  <p> To really understand the best way forward, I would love to chat with you or your assistant about your current challenges with your website and what you are looking for going forward. </p>

  <h2> Process </h2>
  <hr />
  <p> <span>Step 1 - Strategy:</span> I'll engage in a 1x hour Skype strategy call with relevant key parties to discuss goals, the brand, important features and functionality, etc. I'll then go away and come away with a comprehensive website strategy, and design inspiration. </p>

  <p> <span>Step 2 - Design:</span> I'll put together a style tile, wireframe and homepage design that showcases the planned design and UX of the site for your review. This design will be optimised not just to be visually stunning, but to load fast and be easy to update and maintain. It will also be planned with an understanding of the psychology of the user. This will take 1 - 2 weeks. </p>

  <p> <span>Step 3 - Development:</span> After you have reviewed and approved the design we'll get to work building it. We'll be building from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript (no clunky pre-built templates here). I'll conduct comprehensive browser testing, speed testing and website optimisation. This process will take around 1 -2 weeks depending on the scope of the design that we agree on.  </p>

  <p> <span>Step 4 - Review & Upload Content:</span> Now it's time to review the live site (on a hidden domain), upload all of your content (photos, images etc) and teach you how to use the content management system.  </p>

  <h2> Estimate </h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Based on the information I have uncovered from viewing your current website, the number of pages and the complexity of the UX I estimate a total cost of around $2,500 for this comprehensive package. This can include functionality like exit intent popups, proffesional photos taken of your location, a walk through video of Palm House, 10 blog posts optimized for google etc. After the initial consultation I can provide a firm quote. If you are just interested in recieving a basic template I can put something together for you, without all the content or keyword research, photos or videos for $750.
