      <h5>Who am I?</h5>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> A little over 2 years ago I left home and started traveling the world. At the same time, I started a travel blog. Over the years I learned that I loved editing and playing around with my website, as much as I loved writing on my blog and editing my photos. Then recently on a blogging retreat in Bali, I made friends with some pretty inspiring digital nomads, who showed me the power of web design. I chose to then attend a coding course with the Institute of Code. I was inspired by my mentors and the other students, to pursue a business of my own. I am now embarking on new adventures with the ability to fuse my love for writing and photography, with my love of web design. You can check out some websites that I have built below or ready my blog by going to <a href=" http://www.adventuresofamiddlechild.com">www.adventuresofamiddlechild.com</a></p>

          <p>My first website, I built for myself as a project during the coding course. I basically looked up everything to do with websites (on Pinterest of course) and said to the mentors “Teach me ALL of this”. Not only did I walk away learning everything on my coding TO DO list, but I learned so much more. Now that I am several websites in, I see so many errors in that first website, but I still want to share it here with you regardless. I hope it shows how far I have come and how much you can do if you continue to learn. Check it out by clicking below.</p>

          <p>This website I built for my aunt. She has a spray tanning business that she runs, to give her something to do as a stay at home mother. I reached out to her after my course to see if she would want a website where people could look at some before and after shots. It could also be a landing place as her small business continues to grow. I put on their some tips for someone getting their first spray tan, why you should choose an airbrushed tan and much more. It was so fun to work on this personal project with her and I am so excited to hear what her clients think of the site. Check it out by clicking below.</p>

          <h4>Learning to Code</h4>
          <p>My blogging retreat was hosted with the Blonde Abroad and the Institute of Code. And as I shared before, I had this growing love for web design. After speaking with all the mentors from the IOC group, I decided to participate in their coding bootcamp! I had the most amazing experience and learned so much! </p>
