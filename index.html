          <h4>Learning to Code</h4>
          <p>My blogging retreat was hosted with the Blonde Abroad and the Institute of Code. And as I shared before, I had this growing love for web design. After speaking with all the mentors from the IOC group, I decided to participate in their coding bootcamp! I had the most amazing experience and learned so much! </p>
